<h2>My Academic Interests and Aspirations :</h2>
I am interested in SCIENCE as a subject, to be more particular I love Biology. 
I am looking forward to work and achieve things  in the field of medical sciences. Doctors and Medical students have always been my inspiration. I am highly inspired by my father, Dr. Majid. I am looking forward to complete my education in Medical Sciences and pursue MBBS. I want to pursue MBBS because I believe that I can be happy by helping others, serving the mankind while earning money. I have witnessed many medical blunders right in front of my eyes. I want to change the way this field of doctors has turned into a business. I want to live up to the quote by Carl Jung - <i>'Medicine cures diseases, but only doctors can cure patients.'</i>
This point must also be noted that MBBS is my choice but <u>Its not the ONLY choice I have</u>.I want people to know about my abilities and judge me after knowing and experiencing them. Recently, I've been taking interest in Coding and I believe I can achieve many things in this field of education as well. I would like to mention that I can excel in any field of work <b> If I work hard for it.</b>
